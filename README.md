# Self Balancing AI
## Project Structure
  The code is structured as follow:
  - Tests folder contains some results of the experiments such as plot of the functions, recording of some interesting results and some tables;
  - Graphics.py contains all the classes for the graphic visualizzation;
  - PendulumEnv.py contains the class for the Environment training and simiulation;
  - cmd.txt is the file thanks to which the user can give command to the program;
  - log.txt is the log file of the trainig sessions that were executed;
  - main.py is the file to execute to start the program;
  Visual results can be seen at youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U_HstrUaH0
## Instructions for use
  To execute a training session set is_train to True in the main.py file, False for simulate a table.
  In any case is necessary specify the file name which will be used to save the final table, in case of training execution, and to simulate an existing table, in case of simulation.
  It's possible to set the Environment parameters by changing the values in the PendulumEnv initialization (main.py).
  set_reward_param function could be use to change the reward weight (alpha and beta).
  To start the program just execute the following command:
  
  ```shell
  python main.py
  ```
